# Semantic-Parsing-Literature
Some of my favorite literature on Semantic Parsing. I categoried the papers into 3 groups:
- Parsing (Selecting the Grammar Formalism and Inference Procedure)
- Learning (Selecting the type of supervision that could be used)
- Modeling (Selecting the logical language to use and the way to model ‘meaning’)
