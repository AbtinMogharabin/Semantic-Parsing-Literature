# Semantic-Parsing-Literature
Some of my favorite literature on Semantic Parsing. I categoried the papers into 3 groups:
- Parsing (Selecting the Grammr Formalism and Inference Procedure
- Learning (What kind of supervision is available?)
- Modeling (What logical language to use and how to model ‘meaning’?)
